Hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GA) influence the transition from seed to seedling, suppressing genes controlling seed maturation and activating those regulating vegetative growth [3].

Plant growth regulators (PGRs), which can stimulate cell division and elongation in the root system, can help seedlings establish stronger roots [2]. Soaking seeds in PGRs increases root length, allowing plants to access water at greater depths, and thus increasing their tolerance to drought conditions [2].

As a result, the trajectory forms a parabolic path. To accurately measure and predict a projectile's motion, equations of motion can be used, which consider the initial velocity, launch angle, and time. The initial velocity can be split into horizontal and vertical components, and equations for both components can be applied independently. For the horizontal motion, an equation is used that doesn't consider the acceleration due to gravity, while for the vertical motion, the effect of gravity is integrated into the equation. These equations can be used to predict the projectile's motion, including its range and height [5].""",Dynamic Supersonic Base Store Ejection Simulation Using Beggar,"""Static and dynamic conditions throughout various aft supersonic store separation events are examined using the Beggar Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code from Air Force SEEK Eagle Office at Eglin Air Force Base, FL.

As the temperature increases, the atoms in the wire vibrate more, leading to greater resistance and a decrease in electrical conductivity. For example, the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity in iron microwires demonstrates a typical metallic behavior, with room temperature resistance values of about 88 micro-ohm cm [5]. However, the specific effect of temperature on conductivity can vary depending on the material, such as in thermoelectric materials where the efficiency is related to the dimensionless figure of merit and affected by the interdependence of different parameters [3].""","Effects of electromagnetic waves on the electrical properties of

physics,How does the shape of an object affect its resistance to motion through a fluid medium?,"""The shape of an object can significantly impact its resistance to motion through a fluid medium. This resistance, referred to as drag, depends on factors such as the size, shape, and surface texture of the object, along with the properties of the fluid in question. A streamlined shape minimizes drag, while a more irregular or bluff shape increases the force exerted by the fluid on the object, thus making it more resistant to motion. In fluid dynamics, this concept is commonly applied to improve the efficiency of objects such as vehicles and aircraft, where a streamlined design results in reduced fuel consumption and increased speed, due to the lowered drag forces acting against the object's movement through the fluid medium.""",A politics of reminding: Khoisan resurgence and environmental justice in South Africas Sarah Baartman district,"""In the wake of colonial fragmentation and genocide, Indigenous Khoisan resurgence movements in South Africa have mobilised subversive forms of authenticity, including heteroglossic and inventive translanguaging from fragments of Khoekhoegowab.

In some cases, the occurrence of earthquakes is related to the geological area under consideration and its size, as well as the spatial distribution of epicenters, which do not form a simple mono-fractal [2]. Injecting waste brine into underground wells, for example, can increase pore pressure, reduce normal stresses across fault surfaces, and trigger fault movement, as observed in El Dorado, Arkansas [3]. Additionally, electric self-potential variations caused by seasonal lake level changes and fluid flow in the French Alps demonstrate a correlation between geological formations and seismic activity [4].

geology,What geological factors contribute to the formation and sustainability of hydrothermal ecosystems in deep sea environments?,"""Hydrothermal ecosystems in deep sea environments are primarily formed and sustained by geological factors, such as tectonic activity and volcanic processes. These factors promote the circulation of seawater through the oceanic crust, which results in the formation of hydrothermal vents. The seawater is heated by the underlying magma and interacts with crustal rocks, enriching it with minerals and chemical elements. Once the heated and mineral-rich fluid meets the cold deep-sea water, it precipitates, creating chimney-like structures from which the hydrothermal fluid is expelled. These vents provide a unique habitat with diverse microbial and chemosynthetic communities, which serve as primary producers in the food chain. Furthermore, these deep-sea ecosystems are enriched by specialized fauna adapted to extreme conditions, such as high pressure, low oxygen, and varying temperatures, contributing to the overall sustainability of these environments [5].""","""Assessment of goods and services, vulnerability, and conservation status of European seabed biotopes: a stepping stone towards ecosystem-based marine spatial management""","""The goal of ecosystem-based marine spatial management is to maintain marine ecosystems in a healthy, productive and resilient condition; hence, they can sustainably provide the needed goods and services for human welfare.

These soluble rocks allow the rapid flow of water through the karst aquifer, leading to a rapid evolution of the landscape [1]. The movement of groundwater in these landscapes is complex, involving interactions between groundwater and surface water through joints, fractures, faulting, or karst features [2].

The development of sinkholes in karst landscapes is a direct result of the dissolution of these soluble rocks, thereby creating underground voids. As the soil above these voids can no longer support the weight of overlying material, it collapses, forming sinkholes [5]. The formation and enlargement of sinkholes not only impact the landscape visually, but they also pose potential hazards to infrastructure and can affect the quality of water in these areas [3].""",Recent advances in karst research: from theory to fieldwork and applications,"""Karst landscapes and karst aquifers, which are composed of a variety of soluble rocks such as salt, gypsum, anhydrite, limestone, dolomite and quartzite, are fascinating areas of study.

Strong policy conclusions can be - and have been - derived from the standard view. Given that workers in the informal sector earn less than those in the formal sector, a reduction in the minimum wage should reduce income inequality between workers in the two sectors.

The Punic Wars (264 BCE - 146 BCE) played a significant role, as they changed the socio-economic structure in Rome, eliminated the middle or farmer/soldier class, and affected wealth distribution by funneling money to the highest socio-economic classes. The wars also altered the Roman religious and political institutions through extended contact with the East and the acquisition of new land [1].

The Roman army functioned as agents of imperial administration, securing trade networks across the Negev region, which was crucial in maintaining the connections necessary for the flow of luxury goods like frankincense, myrrh, and spices [2]. These goods provided the imperial treasury with a steady stream of revenue through importation, distribution, and taxation.

It allowed industries to break free from the geographical constraints of relying on water and wind power sources, enabling them to locate closer to raw materials and labor forces [1]. This vital transition contributed to accelerated urbanization and the rise of new manufacturing centers [1].

These factors contributed to expanding territories, strong organization, and a highly efficient political system that allowed for remarkable growth and development. On the other hand, the long-term consequences of the Roman Empire's collapse included significant economic and political instability, with territories breaking apart into smaller factions.

Several factors contributed to the rise of the Roman Empire, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the given search results. However, the Third-Century Crisis, which led to instability and upheaval in the Roman Empire due to wars and economic depressions, is cited as one of the main events affecting the stability of the empire [2]. Additionally, the Plague of Cyprian, a devastating disease that impacted the Roman Mediterranean during this crisis, is also mentioned [2].

The collapse of past societies, including the Roman Empire, has been studied in the context of different theories, with environmental collapse being a predominant paradigm [3]. This environmental focus, however, may have obscured the understanding of the role of social processes that significantly impacted the demise of the Roman Empire [3]. In the post-collapse period, the fragmentation of the empire led to political and economic instability, with territories breaking away and forming smaller factions.

Reconstruction policies and investments led to the rapid growth of infrastructure and industry in the North, shaping the national economy for decades. Politically, the Civil War reaffirmed the primacy of the federal government over individual states and brought about transformative constitutional amendments such as the 13th, 14th, and 15th, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to former slaves, and provided voting rights regardless of race, color, or previous servitude, respectively.

geography,"""What are the main factors driving urbanization trends in developing countries, and how do they impact the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of cities in these regions?""","""The main factors driving urbanization trends in developing countries include population growth, economic opportunities, and technological advancements. Rapid population growth and rural-urban migration contribute significantly to the increase in urban densities, as people move to cities in search of better job opportunities and improved living standards [1]. Technological advancements also play a role in promoting urbanization, as cities increasingly adopt smart city concepts to tackle complex urban problems [5].

The impact of these factors on the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of cities in developing countries is mixed. On the one hand, higher urban densities may lead to more efficient use of public infrastructure and transport, as well as offering economic benefits [1]. On the other hand, increased urbanization can adversely affect the environment, due to increased resource consumption, energy demands, and generation of waste [4]. To achieve sustainable urban development, developing countries need to adopt context-specific policies, ensuring a balance between economic growth, social development, and environmental protection, informed by frameworks like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [3].""",Systematic review and comparison of densification effects and planning motivations,"""Do higher urban densities contribute to more sustainable cities and communities?

Determinism suggests that each event results from preceding events or laws of nature, whereas free will holds that individuals can make choices not limited by such constraints. The principle of sufficient reason (PSR) relates to this dilemma, arguing that for every fact or event, there exists a sufficient explanation or reason for that event, entailing determinism. However, there is no conclusive evidence for or against the PSR. Some argue that the counterexample to this principle is libertarianism, which upholds free will, but the evidence for libertarianism is considered weak [1].

philosophy,What is the relationship between free will and determinism in Western philosophy and how does this impact our moral and ethical decision-making?,"""In Western philosophy, the relationship between free will and determinism has long been debated, with various viewpoints emerging over time [2]. Free will is the idea that individuals have the ability to make choices, while determinism holds that all events, including human actions, are determined by causes outside of one's control. The interaction between free will and determinism impacts moral and ethical decision-making, as personal responsibility and decision-making capacity are deeply ingrained in the philosophical debate [1].

A pluralist approach to free will and moral responsibility can accommodate the complexity and apparent contradictions in this debate, including the development of numerous arguments, counterarguments, empirical research, and insights [2]. The notion of free will should be taken into account when evaluating decision-making capacity, as it influences moral courage, ethical leadership, and ethical decision-making in various fields, including healthcare and information technology [1] [3] [4]. Both Buddhism and Christianity emphasize the significance of free will, revealing its central role in understanding human reality within these belief systems [5].""",The notion of free will and its ethical relevance for decision-making capacity.,"""Obtaining informed consent from patients is a moral and legal duty and, thus, a key legitimation for medical treatment.

There are two main schools of thought: compatibilism and incompatibilism. Compatibilism argues that free will and determinism can coexist, meaning individuals can still be morally responsible for their actions even if determinism is true. Incompatibilism, on the other hand, claims that free will and determinism cannot coexist; if determinism is true, then individuals cannot have free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.

Agricultural biodiversity, which contributes to food support systems, is also affected by human influence [1]. Native and exotic fish species can experience local extinction due to land-use changes, with cold-tolerant species being more impacted [2]. To mitigate these effects, both global approaches and case-specific strategies should be considered for diverse ecosystems and wildlife populations [5].""",Ecological and Economic Roles of Agrobiodiversity,"""Biodiversity is a complex, abstract concept. It can be associated with a wide range of benefits to human society, most of them still ill understood. In general terms, the value of biodiversity can be assessed in terms of its impact on the provision of inputs to production processes, in terms of its direct impact on human welfare, and in terms of its impact on the regulation of the nature-ecosystem-ecological functions relationships. The services that agricultural biodiversity provides are critical to the functioning of food support systems. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet.

We hypothesised that colonisation rates would be higher for exotic fish species and that extinction rates would be higher for native species in large stream systems. We also predicted that cold-water species would be more impacted than thermally tolerant species.

education,What strategies can be implemented to improve literacy rates in rural primary schools in developing countries?,"""To improve literacy rates in rural primary schools in developing countries, several strategies can be implemented. First, focusing on early-grade reading and assessment is crucial, as it forms the foundation for future learning [1]. Secondly, reducing dropout rates by adopting cost-effective measures, like stimulating schooling demand, can help achieve universal primary education [2]. Third, investment in school resources, such as reducing class sizes and improving teacher quality, should be a priority [3]. Additionally, enhancing readability curricula and assessments, especially for restorative programs, is necessary [3]. There should be an emphasis on pedagogy, curriculum, teaching practices, and teacher education [4].
